Xake is a make utility made for .NET on F# language. Xake is inspired by [shake](https://github.com/ndmitchell/shake) build tool.

Unlike NAnt, Fake and similar tools with imperative script style, Xake is declarative:

  * you define targets (either files or actions)
  * you describe rules on how to make particular target
  * build tool identifies dependencies and build your targets
